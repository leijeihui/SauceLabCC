1. npm install
2. npm start (might have to wait a little bit before server loads)


BUG
  * Chart min/max times shift unaccordingly
  
  * Assumption: Something with JS Dates causing shift.
  * Temp Solution: Provide counter weight to balance out shift.

  * Minor bug: max date does not affect the chart if date is in the future
